To send GitHub user data to an Excel sheet and retrieve the history of lines added, removed, commits, and pull requests, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries:
   - pandas: `pip install pandas`
   - openpyxl: `pip install openpyxl`
   - PyGithub: `pip install PyGithub`

2. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook
from github import Github
```

3. Authenticate with your GitHub account:
```python
g = Github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME", "YOUR_GITHUB_PASSWORD_OR_TOKEN")
```
   Alternatively, you can use a personal access token instead of a password.

4. Create an Excel workbook and select the active sheet:
```python
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active
```

5. Define the GitHub username(s) you want to retrieve data for:
```python
usernames = ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
```

6. Iterate over the usernames and retrieve the required data:
```python
for username in usernames:
    user = g.get_user(username)
    
    # Retrieve repository data
    for repo in user.get_repos():
        # Retrieve commit data
        for commit in repo.get_commits():
            commit_data = {
                "Username": username,
                "Repository": repo.name,
                "Commit SHA": commit.sha,
                "Lines Added": commit.stats.additions,
                "Lines Removed": commit.stats.deletions
            }
            ws.append(commit_data)
        
        # Retrieve pull request data
        for pr in repo.get_pulls():
            pr_data = {
                "Username": username,
                "Repository": repo.name,
                "Pull Request": pr.title,
                "Lines Added": pr.additions,
                "Lines Removed": pr.deletions
            }
            ws.append(pr_data)
```

7. Save the workbook to an Excel file:
```python
wb.save("github_data.xlsx")
```

This code will iterate over the provided GitHub usernames, retrieve commit and pull request data for each repository, and append it to the Excel sheet. The resulting Excel file will contain the history of lines added, removed, commits, and pull requests for each user.
