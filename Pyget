To get the list of lines added and removed for specific users across all commits and repositories, you can modify the previous program. Here's an updated version that retrieves the information for multiple users and saves it in an Excel sheet:

```python
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import Font
from github import Github

# Replace with your GitHub access token
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

# List of GitHub usernames to track
USERS = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']

# Create a GitHub instance using the access token
g = Github(ACCESS_TOKEN)

# Create a new Excel workbook and select the active sheet
wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Set the column headers
sheet['A1'] = 'Repository'
sheet['B1'] = 'User'
sheet['C1'] = 'Lines Added'
sheet['D1'] = 'Lines Removed'

# Apply bold font to the column headers
bold_font = Font(bold=True)
for cell in sheet[1]:
    cell.font = bold_font

# Initialize the row counter
row = 2

# Iterate over each user
for user in USERS:
    # Get the user object
    github_user = g.get_user(user)

    # Iterate over each repository of the user
    for repo in github_user.get_repos():
        # Get the repository name
        repo_name = repo.full_name

        # Get the list of commits in the repository
        commits = repo.get_commits()

        # Iterate over each commit
        for commit in commits:
            # Get the commit details
            commit_details = commit.commit

            # Get the author of the commit
            author = commit.author

            # Check if the author matches the current user
            if author.login == user:
                # Get the stats for the commit
                stats = commit.stats

                # Get the number of lines added and removed
                lines_added = stats.additions
                lines_removed = stats.deletions

                # Write the details to the Excel sheet
                sheet.cell(row=row, column=1).value = repo_name
                sheet.cell(row=row, column=2).value = author.login
                sheet.cell(row=row, column=3).value = lines_added
                sheet.cell(row=row, column=4).value = lines_removed

                # Increment the row counter
                row += 1

# Save the workbook
wb.save('github_stats.xlsx')
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` with your actual GitHub access token and update the `USERS` list with the GitHub usernames you want to track. The program will iterate over each user's repositories and retrieve the lines added and removed for their commits. The information will be saved in the Excel sheet named `'github_stats.xlsx'`.
