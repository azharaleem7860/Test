To pass repository details instead of user information, you can modify the code as follows:

python import pandas as pd from openpyxl import Workbook from github import Github  # Authenticate with your GitHub Enterprise server g = Github(base_url="https://your-github-enterprise-server-url/api/v3", login_or_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")  # Create an Excel workbook and select the active sheet wb = Workbook() ws = wb.active  # Define the repository(s) you want to retrieve data for repositories = ["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]  # Iterate over the repositories and retrieve the required data for repository in repositories:     repo = g.get_repo(repository)          # Retrieve commit data     for commit in repo.get_commits():         ws.append([             repository,             commit.sha,             commit.stats.additions,             commit.stats.deletions         ])          # Retrieve pull request data     for pr in repo.get_pulls():         ws.append([             repository,             pr.title,             pr.additions,             pr.deletions         ])  # Save the workbook to an Excel file wb.save("github_data.xlsx") 

In this modified code, we define a list of repository names (repositories) instead of usernames. Then, we iterate over the repositories and retrieve the commit and pull request data for each repository. The data is then appended to the worksheet. Finally, the workbook is saved to an Excel file.
