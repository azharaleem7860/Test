I apologize for the confusion. The `KeyError: 'pipelineExecution'` error occurs when the key `'pipelineExecution'` is not present in the `execution_details` dictionary. This error suggests that the response from the `get_pipeline_execution_details()` function does not contain the expected key.

To resolve this issue, you can modify the code to handle the KeyError and check the structure of the response dictionary. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
import boto3
from openpyxl import Workbook

def get_all_pipelines():
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')
    response = client.list_pipelines()
    return response['pipelines']

def get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name):
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')
    response = client.list_pipeline_executions(pipelineName=pipeline_name)
    return response['pipelineExecutionSummaries']

def get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id):
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')
    response = client.get_pipeline_execution(
        pipelineName=pipeline_name,
        pipelineExecutionId=execution_id
    )
    return response.get('pipelineExecution')

def write_to_excel(pipeline_name, history, ws):
    for execution in history:
        execution_id = execution['pipelineExecutionId']
        status = execution['status']
        start_time = execution['startTime']
        end_time = execution['lastUpdateTime']

        execution_details = get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id)
        if execution_details:
            stages = execution_details.get('artifactRevisions')
            if stages:
                for stage in stages:
                    stage_name = stage['revisionId']['name']
                    stage_status = stage['status']
                    stage_start_time = stage['created']
                    stage_end_time = stage['lastUpdated']

                    ws.append([pipeline_name, execution_id, status, start_time, end_time, stage_name, stage_status, stage_start_time, stage_end_time])
        else:
            print(f"Pipeline execution details not found for pipeline: {pipeline_name}, execution ID: {execution_id}")

def main():
    pipelines = get_all_pipelines()

    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active
    ws.append(['Pipeline Name', 'Execution ID', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Stage Name', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time'])

    for pipeline in pipelines:
        pipeline_name = pipeline['name']
        history = get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)
        write_to_excel(pipeline_name, history, ws)

    wb.save('pipeline_history.xlsx')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In the updated code, the `get_pipeline_execution_details()` function is modified to handle the KeyError. It checks if the `'pipelineExecution'` key is present in the response dictionary using the `get()` method. If the key is not found, it returns `None`.

The `write_to_excel()` function is also updated to handle cases where the pipeline execution details are not found. It checks if the `execution_details` variable is `None` before accessing its values. If the details are not found, it prints a message indicating the pipeline and execution ID.

By handling the KeyError and checking the structure of the response dictionary, you can avoid the error and gracefully handle cases where the expected key is not present in the response.
