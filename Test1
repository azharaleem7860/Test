Apologies for the confusion. If the existing Excel file is not found, you can modify the code to create a new Excel file with the desired name and write the data to it. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook
from github import Github
from datetime import datetime

# Authenticate with your GitHub personal access token
g = Github('YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN')

# Specify the usernames
usernames = ['USERNAME1', 'USERNAME2', 'USERNAME3']

# Create a new Excel workbook
commit_history = pd.DataFrame(columns=['User', 'Repo', 'Commit ID', 'Author', 'Date', 'Lines Added', 'Lines Removed'])
writer = pd.ExcelWriter('commit_history_2023.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')
commit_history.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Commit History', index=False)
writer.save()

# Load the newly created Excel file
commit_history = pd.read_excel('commit_history_2023.xlsx', sheet_name='Commit History', engine='openpyxl')
writer = pd.ExcelWriter('commit_history_2023.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')
writer.book = Workbook()
writer.sheets = dict((ws.title, ws) for ws in writer.book.worksheets)

# Fetch the user details, repos, commits, timelines, lines added, and lines removed for each user
for username in usernames:
    user = g.get_user(username)
    
    for repo in user.get_repos():
        commits = repo.get_commits(since=datetime(2023, 1, 1), until=datetime(2023, 12, 31))
        
        for commit in commits:
            commit_id = commit.sha
            author = commit.commit.author.name
            date = commit.commit.author.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z')  # Convert datetime to string
            lines_added = commit.stats.additions
            lines_removed = commit.stats.deletions
            
            commit_history = commit_history.append({'User': username, 'Repo': repo.name, 'Commit ID': commit_id, 'Author': author, 'Date': date, 'Lines Added': lines_added, 'Lines Removed': lines_removed}, ignore_index=True)

# Write the DataFrame to the Excel sheet
commit_history.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Commit History', index=False)

# Save the changes
writer.save()
```

In this updated version, a new Excel workbook is created with the desired name `'commit_history_2023.xlsx'`. The `commit_history` DataFrame is initially saved to this workbook as an empty sheet named 'Commit History'. The workbook is then loaded and updated with the fetched data.

Please note that if the Excel file already exists, it will be overwritten with a new empty sheet named 'Commit History'.
