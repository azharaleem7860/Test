To add user information for the commits in the Excel worksheet, you can modify the code to include the author's name and email address. Here's an example:

python import pandas as pd from openpyxl import Workbook from github import Github from datetime import datetime, timedelta import pytz  # Authenticate with your GitHub Enterprise server g = Github(base_url="https://your-github-enterprise-server-url/api/v3", login_or_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")  # Create an Excel workbook and select the active sheet wb = Workbook() ws = wb.active  # Define the repository(s) you want to retrieve data for repositories = ["HIG/repo1", "HIG/repo2", "HIG/repo3"]  # Set the timezone for the start_date and end_date timezone = pytz.timezone("YOUR_TIMEZONE") start_date = timezone.localize(start_date) end_date = timezone.localize(end_date)  # Calculate the date range for the last 3 months end_date = datetime.now(timezone) start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=90)  # Insert headers for commits ws.append(["Repository", "Commit SHA", "Author Name", "Author Email", "Additions", "Deletions", "Commit Date"])  # Iterate over the repositories and retrieve the required data for repository in repositories:     repo = g.get_repo(repository)          # Retrieve commit data for the last 3 months     for commit in repo.get_commits(since=start_date, until=end_date):         ws.append([             repository,             commit.sha,             commit.commit.author.name,             commit.commit.author.email,             commit.stats.additions,             commit.stats.deletions,             commit.commit.author.date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")         ])  # Save the workbook to an Excel file wb.save("github_data.xlsx") 

In this modified code, the ws.append(["Repository", "Commit SHA", "Author Name", "Author Email", "Additions", "Deletions", "Commit Date"]) line is added before the loop that retrieves commit data to insert the headers for commits. The commit.commit.author.name and commit.commit.author.email attributes are included in the ws.append() line to append the author's name and email address to the worksheet.
