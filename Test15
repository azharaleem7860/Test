You are correct. Excel does not support storing datetimes with time zones directly. However, you can convert the datetime objects to a timezone-aware string representation before writing them to Excel. Here's an updated version of the program that converts the datetime objects to strings:

```python
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook, load_workbook
from github import Github
from datetime import datetime

# Authenticate with your GitHub personal access token
g = Github('YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN')

# Specify the usernames
usernames = ['USERNAME1', 'USERNAME2', 'USERNAME3']

# Create a new Workbook if it doesn't exist
try:
    book = load_workbook('commit_history_2023.xlsx')
    writer = pd.ExcelWriter('commit_history_2023.xlsx', engine='openpyxl') 
    writer.book = book
except FileNotFoundError:
    writer = pd.ExcelWriter('commit_history_2023.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')

# Create a DataFrame to store the commit history
commit_history = pd.DataFrame(columns=['User', 'Repo', 'Commit ID', 'Author', 'Date', 'Lines Added', 'Lines Removed'])

# Fetch the user details, repos, commits, timelines, lines added, and lines removed for each user
for username in usernames:
    user = g.get_user(username)
    
    for repo in user.get_repos():
        commits = repo.get_commits(since=datetime(2023, 1, 1), until=datetime(2023, 12, 31))
        
        for commit in commits:
            commit_id = commit.sha
            author = commit.commit.author.name
            date = commit.commit.author.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z')  # Convert datetime to string
            lines_added = commit.stats.additions
            lines_removed = commit.stats.deletions
            
            commit_history = commit_history.append({'User': username, 'Repo': repo.name, 'Commit ID': commit_id, 'Author': author, 'Date': date, 'Lines Added': lines_added, 'Lines Removed': lines_removed}, ignore_index=True)

# Write the DataFrame to the Excel sheet
commit_history.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Commit History', index=False)

# Save the changes
writer.save()
```

In this updated version, the `date` field is converted to a string representation using the `strftime` method with the desired format. This format includes the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, timezone abbreviation, and UTC offset. You can adjust the format as needed.

By converting the datetime objects to strings, you can store them in Excel without losing the timezone information.
