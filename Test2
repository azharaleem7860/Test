To get all the CodePipeline history details, including status, start time, and end time, for all pipelines across an AWS account and store them in an Excel sheet, you can modify the previous code. Here's an updated version of the Python program:

```python
import boto3
import pandas as pd

def get_all_pipelines():
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')
    response = client.list_pipelines()
    return response['pipelines']

def get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name):
    client = boto3.client('codepipeline')
    response = client.list_pipeline_executions(pipelineName=pipeline_name)
    return response['pipelineExecutionSummaries']

def main():
    pipelines = get_all_pipelines()

    data = []
    columns = ['Pipeline Name', 'Execution ID', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time']

    for pipeline in pipelines:
        pipeline_name = pipeline['name']
        history = get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)

        for execution in history:
            execution_id = execution['pipelineExecutionId']
            status = execution['status']
            start_time = execution['startTime']
            end_time = execution['lastUpdateTime']

            data.append([pipeline_name, execution_id, status, start_time, end_time])

    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
    df.to_excel('pipeline_history.xlsx', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this updated code, the `get_all_pipelines()` function retrieves a list of all pipelines in the AWS account. The `get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)` function retrieves the execution history for a specific pipeline.

The `main()` function iterates over all pipelines, retrieves their execution history, and stores the relevant information (pipeline name, execution ID, status, start time, and end time) in the `data` list.

Finally, the `data` list is converted into a pandas DataFrame, and the DataFrame is saved as an Excel file named "pipeline_history.xlsx" using the `to_excel()` function.

Make sure to have the necessary AWS credentials configured for the `boto3` library to access the CodePipeline API.
