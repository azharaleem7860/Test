You're correct, Excel does not support datetimes with timezones. If you want to remove the timezone information from the datetimes before writing them to the Excel file, you can use the strftime method to format the datetimes as strings without the timezone.

Here's an updated version of the code that removes the timezone information from the datetimes:

python import boto3 import pandas as pd  def get_all_pipelines():     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipelines()     return response['pipelines']  def get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipeline_executions(pipelineName=pipeline_name)     return response['pipelineExecutionSummaries']  def get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.get_pipeline_execution(         pipelineName=pipeline_name,         pipelineExecutionId=execution_id     )     return response['pipelineExecution']  def main():     pipelines = get_all_pipelines()      data = []     columns = ['Pipeline Name', 'Execution ID', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Stages']      for pipeline in pipelines:         pipeline_name = pipeline['name']         history = get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)          for execution in history:             execution_id = execution['pipelineExecutionId']             status = execution['status']             start_time = execution['startTime'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')             end_time = execution['lastUpdateTime'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')              execution_details = get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id)             print(f"Execution Details: {execution_details}")              stages = execution_details.get('stageStates', [])             stage_statuses = [f"{stage['stageName']}: {stage['latestExecution']['status']}" for stage in stages]              data.append([pipeline_name, execution_id, status, start_time, end_time, ", ".join(stage_statuses)])      df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)     df.to_excel('pipeline_history.xlsx', index=False)  if __name__ == '__main__':     main() 

In this updated code, the strftime method is used to format the startTime and lastUpdateTime datetimes as strings without the timezone. The format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' is used, but you can modify it to match your desired datetime format.
