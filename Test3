Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was an error in the code. The correct parameter name for the pipeline name in the get_pipeline_execution() method is "name" instead of "pipelineName". Here's the corrected code:

python import boto3 import pandas as pd from dateutil import parser  def get_all_pipelines():     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipelines()     return response['pipelines']  def get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipeline_executions(name=pipeline_name)     return response['pipelineExecutionSummaries']  def get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.get_pipeline_execution(         name=pipeline_name,         pipelineExecutionId=execution_id     )     return response['pipelineExecution']  def main():     pipelines = get_all_pipelines()      data = []     columns = ['Pipeline Name', 'Execution ID', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time']      for pipeline in pipelines:         pipeline_name = pipeline['name']         history = get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)          for execution in history:             execution_id = execution['pipelineExecutionId']             status = execution['status']             start_time = parser.parse(execution['startTime']).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')             end_time = parser.parse(execution['lastUpdateTime']).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')              execution_details = get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id)             # Extract additional details from execution_details as needed              data.append([pipeline_name, execution_id, status, start_time, end_time])      df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)     df.to_excel('pipeline_history.xlsx', index=False)  if __name__ == '__main__':     main() 

In this corrected code, the parameter name in the list_pipeline_executions() method is changed to name=pipeline_name and the parameter name in the get_pipeline_execution() method is changed to name=pipeline_name. This should resolve the issue and allow you to retrieve the pipeline execution details correctly.
