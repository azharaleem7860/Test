I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that CodePipeline does not have a describe_pipeline_execution method. 

To retrieve the pipeline execution details, you can use the get_pipeline_execution method from the boto3 library. Here's an updated version of the code:

python import boto3 import pandas as pd  def get_all_pipelines():     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipelines()     return response['pipelines']  def get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.list_pipeline_executions(pipelineName=pipeline_name)     return response['pipelineExecutionSummaries']  def get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id):     client = boto3.client('codepipeline')     response = client.get_pipeline_execution(         pipelineName=pipeline_name,         pipelineExecutionId=execution_id     )     return response['pipelineExecution']  def main():     pipelines = get_all_pipelines()      data = []     columns = ['Pipeline Name', u'Execution ID', 'Status', 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Stages']      for pipeline in pipelines:         pipeline_name = pipeline['name']         history = get_pipeline_history(pipeline_name)          for execution in history:             execution_id = execution['pipelineExecutionId']             status = execution['status']             start_time = execution['startTime']             end_time = execution['lastUpdateTime']              execution_details = get_pipeline_execution_details(pipeline_name, execution_id)             print(f"Execution Details: {execution_details}")              stages = execution_details.get('stageStates', [])             stage_statuses = [f"{stage['stageName']}: {stage['latestExecution']['status']}" for stage in stages]              data.append([pipeline_name, execution_id, status, start_time, end_time, ", ".join(stage_statuses)])      df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)     df.to_excel('pipeline_history.xlsx', index=False)  if __name__ == '__main__':     main() 

In this updated code, the get_pipeline_execution_details function uses the get_pipeline_execution method to retrieve the pipeline execution details. The rest of the code remains the same.
