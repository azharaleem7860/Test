To get all users' information across a GitHub Enterprise instance, you can use the GitHub Enterprise REST API. Here's an example using the `requests` library in Python:

```python
import requests

# Set the base URL for your GitHub Enterprise instance
base_url = "https://your-github-enterprise-server-url/api/v3"

# Set the access token for authentication
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Make a GET request to the GitHub Enterprise API endpoint for users
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/users", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"})

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get the users' information from the response
    users_info = response.json()
    
    # Print the users' information
    for user_info in users_info:
        print(user_info)
else:
    # Print an error message if the request was not successful
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

In this example, replace `"https://your-github-enterprise-server-url/api/v3"` with the base URL of your GitHub Enterprise instance. Set the `access_token` variable to a valid access token with appropriate permissions to access user information.

The code sends a GET request to the GitHub Enterprise API endpoint for users (`{base_url}/users`) and includes the access token in the request headers for authentication. If the request is successful, it prints the users' information.

You can access specific user information by using the corresponding keys in the `user_info` dictionary. For example, `user_info["login"]` will give you the user's username, `user_info["name"]` will give you the user's name, and so on.

Please note that you may need to adjust the API endpoint or authentication method based on your GitHub Enterprise configuration. Refer to the GitHub Enterprise API documentation for more details on available endpoints and authentication options.
